        <h3>The Fox & the Grapes</h3>
        <div class="inner-tale">
          <p>
            A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes emed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.
            <br>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.
            <br>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.
            <br>"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."
            <br>And off he walked very, very scornfully.
            <br><br><em>There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.</em>

        <h3>The Wolf & the Crane</h3>
        <div class="inner-tale">
          <p>
            A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.
            <br>So away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.
            <br>"I will reward you very handsomely," said the Wolf, "if you pull that bone out for me."
            <br>The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.
            <br>When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.
            <br>"But what about my reward!" called the Crane anxiously.
            <br>"What!" snarled the Wolf, whirling around. "Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?"
            <br><br><em>Expect no reward for serving the wicked.</em>

        <h3>The Two Goats</h3>
        <div class="inner-tale">
          <p>
            Two Goats, frisking gayly on the rocky steeps of a mountain valley, chanced to meet, one on each side of a deep chasm through which poured a mighty mountain torrent. The trunk of a fallen tree formed the only means of crossing the chasm, and on this not even two squirrels could have passed each other in safety. The narrow path would have made the bravest emble. Not so our Goats. Their pride would not permit either to stand aside for the other.
            <br>One set her foot on the log. The other did likewise. In the middle they met horn to horn. Neither would give way, and so they both fell, to be swept away by the roaring torrent below.
            <br><br><em>It is better to yield than to come to misfortune through stubbornness.</em>
